#Command Line Tic Tac Toe

This game of Tic Tac Toe is either single or multiplayer, depending on user
specifications. If there is only one player, the opponent is a computer, 
whose AI isn't very good since it guesses positions randomly.

To play:
$ ./bin/tic_tac_toe -m [single, multiplayer]

Other options are prompted during game play.
